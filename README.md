## What is Admiral?

This project provides an enterprise container management solution, which can help enterprises reduce complexity and achieve advantages including simplified and automated application delivery, optimized resource utilization along with business governance and applying business policies, release management and overall data center integration. 

Admiral is a service written in Java and based on VMware's [Xenon framework](https://github.com/vmware/xenon/). This service enables the users to:
- manage Docker hosts, where containers will be deployed
- manage Policies (together with Resource Pools, Deployment Policies, etc.), to establish the preferences about what host(s) a container deployment will actually use
- manage Templates (including one or more container images) and Docker Registries
- manage Containers and Applications
- manage other common and required entities like credentials, certificates, etc.
